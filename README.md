# 20 Years of ISMIR - Community Video

This github project provides infos and files for ISMIR 2019's community contributions: "Variations on ISMIR"

## Background

This idea goes back to the [first ISMIR logo](https://github.com/martingasser/ismir-variations/blob/master/Mozart_Variations-K265_Data/ISMIR_oldLogo.png), which was proposed during the first ISMIR 2000 in Plymouth, MA. The full history is documented under the 10 years anniversary paper by Downie et al. (Section 2.1):

[TEN YEARS OF ISMIR:
REFLECTIONS ON CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES ](http://ismir2009.ismir.net/proceedings/keynote1.pdf)

## Data: Audio

We have two interpretations of the piece by pianists [Simone Renzi](https://github.com/martingasser/ismir-variations/tree/master/Mozart_Variations-K265_Data/Audio/Renzi_IMSLP) and [Stefano Ligoratti](https://github.com/martingasser/ismir-variations/tree/master/Mozart_Variations-K265_Data/Audio/Ligoratti_IMSLP). Both are published at [IMSLP](<http://imslp.org/wiki/12_Variations_on_%22Ah%2C_vous_dirai-je_maman%22%2C_K.265%2F300e_(Mozart%2C_Wolfgang_Amadeus)>) under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

**Beyond the full-size original audio files, we provide edited versions with Theme and all Variations in separate tracks.**

## Data: Score

We have a MIDI and pdf score published on IMSLP by JÃ¼rgen Knuth under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike 3.0 license:

[12 Variations on "Ah, vous dirai-je maman", K.265/300e](<http://imslp.org/wiki/12_Variations_on_%22Ah%2C_vous_dirai-je_maman%22%2C_K.265%2F300e_(Mozart%2C_Wolfgang_Amadeus)>)

Furthermore, we have a scan from the facsimile, also from IMSLP.

**For your convenience, we OMR-ed and corrected the pdf.** The derived [files](https://github.com/martingasser/ismir-variations/tree/master/Mozart_Variations-K265_Data/Score) (Sibelius, pdf, MusicXML, MIDI, Rendered Audio) are denoted with the suffix "\_Sibelius".

Another good source is the Neue Mozart Ausgabe (New Mozart Edition), published as pdf for study purposes by Mozarteum Foundation, Salzburg:

https://dme.mozarteum.at/nmaonline/

Just search for KV = 265.

**We are looking for many interesting and entertaining contributions!**
