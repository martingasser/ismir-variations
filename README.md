## Background

This idea goes back to the first ISMIR logo (ISMIR_oldLogo.png), which was proposed during the first ISMIR 2000 in Plymouth, MA. The full history is documented under the 10 years anniversary paper by Downie et al. (Section 2.1):

## Audio:

We have two interpretations of the piece by pianists Simone Renzi and Stefano Ligoratti. Both are published at IMSLP (http://imslp.org) under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

__Beyond the full-size original audio file, we provide an edited version with Theme and all Variations in separate tracks. __

## Score:

We have a MIDI and pdf score published on IMSLP by JÃ¼rgen Knuth under a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial Share Alike 3.0 license:

Furthermore, we have a scan from the facsimile, also from IMSLP.

__For your convenience, we OMR-ed and corrected the pdf. The derived files (Sibelius, pdf, MusicXML, MIDI, Rendered Audio) are denoted with the suffix "_Sibelius". __

Another good source is the Neue Mozart Ausgabe (New Mozart Edition), published as pdf for study purposes by Mozarteum Foundation, Salzburg:
